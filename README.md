# Advanced-SQL-Based-Student-Management-System
Secure, automated, and user-friendly SQL solution for managing student and teacher data, including role-based access, views, stored procedures, and user-defined functions for school store operations.
## INTRODUCTION:  
Following the successful implementation of the initial student management system, Greenfield Academy is excited to take the next step in enhancing its database functionality.  
These upgrades aim to improve usability for non-technical staff, automating important administrative tasks, and providing support for the new school store.  

## AIMS:
- To expand database capabilities for administrative and commercial activities.
- To implement automation and simplification tools within the database.  

## OBJECTIVES:
1. Simplify data retrieval with views.
2. Automate student registration using stored procedures.
3. Enable flexible price calculation with user-defined functions.  

## PROBLEM STATEMENT:
The previous implementation provided secure access control, but the system lacked usability features for non-technical users and support for new institutional functions like the school store. There is a need for views, stored procedures, and functions to improve efficiency and functionality.  

## SOLUTION OVERVIEW:
This phase of the project provides advanced features to support ease of use and new operational demands. **Uploaded as "Code II. sql"**
